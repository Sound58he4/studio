// This file is intentionally left empty as the component logic
// has been moved to src/components/report/ReportErrorState.tsx
// This preserves the old file path in case it's referenced elsewhere,
// but the component itself should be imported from the new location.

// You can delete this file if you are sure no other parts of the code
// still reference this specific path.

export {}; // Add an empty export to make it a module
