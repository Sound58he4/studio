# Friends Messaging and Level System Implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Messaging System in Friends Section

**Problem**: The FriendChatModal was using a mock messaging system instead of real Firestore integration.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `FriendChatModal.tsx` to use real Firestore chat service
- Added proper authentication integration with `useAuth` context
- Implemented real-time message listening with `onSnapshot`
- Connected to existing `chatService.ts` for message sending/receiving
- Messages now properly deliver between users through Firestore

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/friends/FriendChatModal.tsx`

### 2. Added Level System Based on Points

**Problem**: Friends page didn't show user levels based on their total points.

**Solution**:
- Created level calculation system: 1 level per 1000 points
- Added `level` and `totalPoints` fields to `UserFriend` interface
- Updated `getFriends()` to fetch points data and calculate levels
- Updated Friends page UI to display levels and points
- Created utility functions for level calculations

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/dashboard/types.ts` - Added level/points to UserFriend and SearchResultUser
- `src/services/firestore/socialService.ts` - Enhanced to fetch points and calculate levels
- `src/app/friends/page.tsx` - Updated UI to display levels and points
- `src/lib/utils/levelCalculator.ts` - New utility for level calculations

### 3. Level Calculation Rules

- **Level 1**: 0-999 points
- **Level 2**: 1000-1999 points  
- **Level 3**: 2000-2999 points
- **And so on...**

Formula: `Level = Math.floor(totalPoints / 1000) + 1`

### 4. UI Updates

**Mobile View**:
- Added level badge next to friend name
- Shows points count in status line
- Example: "Online â€¢ 2,500 points"

**Desktop View**: 
- Level badge prominently displayed
- Points shown in status area
- Replaces previous mock level data

### 5. Search Users Enhancement

- Updated user search to also include level/points information
- Consistent level display across all user interactions

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Messaging**: 
   - Go to Friends page
   - Click message button next to any friend
   - Send a message - it should deliver to the friend's chat
   - Friend can respond and messages appear in real-time

2. **Levels**:
   - Check Friends page to see level badges
   - Levels should be calculated based on actual user points
   - Points total displayed in user status

## Technical Details

- Uses existing Firestore chat infrastructure (`chats` collection)
- Leverages existing points system (`users/{id}/points/current`)
- Real-time updates via Firestore listeners
- Graceful fallbacks for users without points data (defaults to Level 1)
- Optimized to fetch points data efficiently for multiple friends

## Future Enhancements

- Add level-up notifications
- Level-based badges or rewards
- Leaderboard based on levels
- Level progress indicators
- Social features around level competition
